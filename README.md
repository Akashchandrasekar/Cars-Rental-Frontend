## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (or yarn) for package management

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-rental-frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd vehicle-rental-frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. After the installation is complete, start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the application in action.

### Build for Production

To create a production-ready build of the frontend application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` folder that you can deploy to a web server.

## Frontend Structure

### `/src`

- **`/components`**: Contains reusable components for vehicle listings, booking forms, reviews, payment options, etc.
- **`/pages`**: Contains the main pages of the application (e.g., Home, Vehicle Details, Booking, User Profile, Admin Dashboard).
- **`/services`**: Contains API service functions for communicating with the backend (e.g., fetching vehicle listings, submitting reviews).
- **`/assets`**: Stores images, icons, and other assets used in the application.
- **`/styles`**: Contains global CSS/SCSS files and component-specific styles.

### Example Components:

- **VehicleList**: Displays a list of vehicles available for rent with options to filter and search.
- **VehicleDetail**: Shows detailed information about a selected vehicle, including booking options.
- **BookingForm**: Allows users to book a vehicle by selecting dates and submitting payment details.
- **UserProfile**: Allows users to view and manage their profile, bookings, and rental history.
- **AdminDashboard**: Admin interface to manage vehicles, bookings, and users.

### Example Pages:

- **HomePage**: Displays the homepage with a list of featured vehicles and search options.
- **BookingPage**: Displays a calendar and form to allow users to make bookings.
- **AdminPage**: Admin dashboard to manage bookings, users, and vehicle listings.
  
## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React Router DOM**: For managing routing and navigation.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **react-toastify**: For displaying toast notifications.
- **react-datepicker**: For date picker functionality.
- **Stripe / Razorpay**: For payment processing integration.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS framework.

## Authentication

- The system uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for user authentication. Users must be logged in to book a vehicle, leave reviews, or access rental history.
- Admins also authenticate via JWT and have access to an admin dashboard for managing vehicles and users.

## Payment Gateway Integration

The frontend integrates with **Stripe** (or **Razorpay**, depending on your preference). Users will enter payment details during booking, and payments will be processed securely.

## Deployment

To deploy the frontend:

1. Build the application for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the contents of the `build` folder to your preferred hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, etc.).

## Troubleshooting

- If the application is not displaying as expected, ensure that you have the correct **API endpoint** for your backend. Check the `services/api.js` file and update the base URL to match your backend deployment.
- For any errors or issues, open the browser's developer console (press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` in most browsers) to view the detailed error logs.
